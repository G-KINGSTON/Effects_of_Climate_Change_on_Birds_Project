# **Effects of Climate Change on Birds 🐦🌍**  
*A research-based project analyzing how climate change impacts bird species and their habitats.*  

![Climate Change & Birds](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/your-image.png)  

## **📌 Overview**  
Climate change is drastically altering ecosystems, and bird populations are among the most affected. This project explores how rising temperatures, habitat loss, and extreme weather impact bird migration, breeding, and survival rates.  

## **🔍 Key Areas of Study**  
✅ Changes in bird migration patterns  
✅ Impact on breeding and nesting habits  
✅ Loss of habitat due to deforestation and temperature rise  
✅ Population decline and species extinction risks  

## **📂 Project Structure**
